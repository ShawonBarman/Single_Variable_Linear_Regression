This is a basic machine learning project. Simple or single variable linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous variables: (a) one variable, denoted x, is regarded as the predictor, explanatory, or independent variable, (b) the other variable, denoted y, is regarded as the response, outcome, or dependent variable.
